## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on IoT SaaS, Food Safety Regulatory Compliance Software, and Startup Acceleration PaaS.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently growing: figs, cherries, huckleberries, thimbleberries, hazelnuts/filberts, and a bunch of herbs and some things that aren't to eat.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about IoT, Robotics, Cloud Architecture, or Food!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: In addition to Modern food safety, I'm also into tradiational food preservation methods.  I make my own cheese, charcuterie, preserves, and fermeted foods.
- ðŸ›¶ Hobbies: Robotics, IoT, Food Preservation, Cheesemaking, Dry Aging Meats, Smoking Meats, Kayaking, Travel, Reading (Science Fiction and Fantasy and occasionally theoretical physics), Nature photography, etc. I especially love exploring the mountains and waterfalls around the PNW.
